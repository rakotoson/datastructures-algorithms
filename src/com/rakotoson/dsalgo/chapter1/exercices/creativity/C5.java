 * The p-norm of a vector v = (v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n ) in n-dimensional space is defined as

 * For the special case of p = 2, this results in the traditional Euclidean norm,

 * 4 2 + 3 2 = 16 + 9 = 25 = 5. Give an implementation of a method named
 * norm such that norm(v, p) returns the p-norm value of v and norm(v) returns the
 * Euclidean norm of v, where v is represented as an array of coordinates.
